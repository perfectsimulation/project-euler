/*	Problem 6
	Sum Square Difference

	The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is

	1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
	
	The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is

	(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

	Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
	natural numbers and the square of the sum is

	3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

	Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
	one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
